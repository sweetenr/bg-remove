This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

```
use node 18
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) with your browser to see the result.

There are a number of buttons on the page:

![home](/docs/media/bg-screen.png)

before trying any of these, you'll need to place any folders/files into `public/unprocessed` like below:

![unprocessed](/docs/media/unprocessedFolder.png)

`skuReport` & `find failed JPG files` will create a log file in the `public/processed` folder:

![logs](/docs/media/processedLogs.png)

I **Highly** recommend using VS Code so you can format the generated json log files, otherwise they are impossible to read..
